lasso_8to9
==========

lasso_8to9 is an AppleScript for BBEdit that converts Lasso 8 syntax to Lasso 9.

Installation
------------
I like to create folders in my BBEdit AppleScript folder to better organize my scripts.
I also use the notation on the folder name to permit sorting by numering values, e.g.,
"##)Folder Name".  BBEdit does not display "##)" in the Scripts menu, but it will sort
by its value.  Create a new directory:

  /Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts/07)Lasso/

Move the script to the new directory.

  /Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts/07)Lasso/8to9.scpt

It should show up immediately under the Scripts menu.
